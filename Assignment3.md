# Assignment 3

Instructions

This assignment covers all parts of the course. Your task is to analyze one of the following datasets according to the instructions on the page. If you have your own dataset you find specifically interesting or relevant for you, email the course teachers and present the dataset and planned analysis.

    Covid data
    SHARE data
    Titanic data
    House price data

Present your findings in a report. The report should be easy to read and follow for someone else who has taken the course and summarize your work, from EDA to analysis and discussion. You do not need to include the instructions given in this file or thoroughly describe the data. Your report is a technical assessment of the problem and you may assume that the reader has read the instructions to the assignments as well.

The report should be maximum two pages (excluding title page, figures and/or tables) and be submitted in PDF format. The R code used for the analysis should be submitted together with the report here on canvas. Make sure the script runs from top to bottom without errors.
Contents

Your report should include the following

    Title and author.
    EDA: Explore which variables are related to each other in at least two ways using
        bar charts, box plots, histograms, etc. and
        correlations or a correlation matrix plot.
    Regression modelling
        Motivation for model choice.
        Motivation for variables included using for example variable selection strategies, significance tests, domain knowledge, VIF values and/or results from EDA.
    Results
        Model coefficents and R2 or accuracy of the final model.
        Short discussion of the results.
    Discussion
        When should the model be used? For what population does it apply?
        Potential issues with the study or what could have been done differently.
        Suggestion for future studies.
    At least one figure created using R (More than one is encouraged and figures do not count towards the page limit). Note: All figures and tables should be numbered and referred to in the text.

An example report based on the car data analysis can be found
here
. You are free to use any tool for writing the report, as long as the content aligns well with your analysis. You are not allowed to straight up copy text from the example report without modification.
